This is my first project using node.js

When i first explored node.js i learned how to manipulate files creating an app with the same functionality as DIR command 
So i decided to create scripts for the following commands: del, move, rename, help and cd.

The only command that doesnt work how it should is cd, because i could only make it to change the working directory but not the prompt 

Later i will update the repository with other important commands like copy

Thank you
